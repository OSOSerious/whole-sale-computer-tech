      "This company is awesome. I used another data recovery business first unfortunately who spent over 3 weeks on our drive and was not able to recover data. I then sent drive to Preston at Wholesale Computers and Technology. He was very upfront with me about odds of recovery. He communicated with us throughout the whole process and completely restored drive. We have been in business for over 30 years and I can tell you, this is by far, the best computer company we have seen. Our whole staff thanks you for restoring all of our point of sale files along with everything else!"
